## Uncategorized miscellaneous notes
These will be categorized and put into separate files in time.

- Worten, worten.pt - for electronics
- Ikea, ikea.pt - for furniture

### Shopping malls
- Colombo

### Current agenda and issues
- Golden visa program really sky rocketed the housing prices, as well as common living expenses. Wages didn't scale accordingly so cost of living is somewhat a problem.


### Culture
- Dining is per reservation usually, for dinner.
- Dinner time is usually between 8pm-10pm. 7pm earliest.
- Couvert comes in initially when you sit at a table in a restaurant, it mainly consists of bread, olive, olive oil, cheese. Exact ingredients may vary. Beware couvert is paid for, it is not free. So either don't eat it or send it back if you don't wanna pay.
- Tipping is not mandatory unlike US, but it is greatly appreciated. ~10% is the standard rate.
- Super local/native places still process only cash, but most places accept credit card payments.


### Transportation
- Uber is available but prefer the local alternative "Bolt". Bolt is cheaper and more people use it.
- (Lisbon specific) Trams are really crowded, and usually full of tourists. So just walk you fat ass, work those muscles.
