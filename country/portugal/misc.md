### Current agenda and issues
- Golden visa program really sky rocketed the housing prices, as well as common living expenses. Wages didn't scale accordingly so cost of living is somewhat a problem.


### Culture
- Dining is per reservation usually, for dinner.
- Dinner time is usually between 8pm-10pm. 7pm earliest.
- Couvert comes in initially when you sit at a table in a restaurant, it mainly consists of bread, olive, olive oil, cheese. Exact ingredients may vary. Beware couvert is paid for, it is not free. So either don't eat it or send it back if you don't wanna pay.
- Tipping is not mandatory unlike US, there is no tipping culture.But it is greatly appreciated. ~10% is the standard rate.
- Super local/native places still process only cash, but most places accept credit card payments.
- 'Time out market' is for tourists
- Don't eat in Baixa district/street, it is a tourist trap. Overpriced and not local-owned.
- Don't fall for the "free shot" trap, it is usually low-alchocol concentration drink to lure you into the bar.
- Santa Justa Elevator is for birds, don't pay it, it is not worth it.
- Northern regions are more welcoming foreigners

### Transportation
- Uber is available but prefer the local alternative "Bolt". Bolt is cheaper and more people use it.
- (Lisbon specific) Trams are really crowded, and usually full of tourists. So just walk you fat ass, work those muscles. 

### Attractions
- Sao Jorge Castle (Lisbon). Buy the tickets online! Line is just endless.
- [!] Look out for "miradouro" signs, they indicate vantage points for great view
- Sintra (not the 'portela de sintra', it is slightly away from the main attraction). You may buy attraction tickets online, and you would get 15% discount. But you must buy it in 3 days advance. https://bilheteira.parquesdesintra.pt/home
- Devil's bridge (Ponte da Mizarela), located in Braga
