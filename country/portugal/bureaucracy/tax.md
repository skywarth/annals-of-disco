## NHR (Non-Habitual Residency) Program

- Started in 2008
- Foreigners living in Portugal would be excempt from flat income tax for 20%, for 10 years
- Goal was to make Portugal more attractive to foreign talent and investors
- It got removed at the end of 2023 (pepe hands)
- NHR 2.0 (renewed version) only applies to scientific and academic employments, so other high-value professionals are no longer eligible
- Certified and legal startup employees are also eligible, but they need to be properly recognized
