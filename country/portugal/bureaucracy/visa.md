# Portugal D3 Visa

D3 visa is for highly skilled professionals

- Salary at least 1.5 times the national minimum wage (€1800 at the time of writing 27/07/2024)
- Requires higher education diploma or 5-6 years of experience. Although as of late, immigration office is tend to decline no-diploma applications that rely solely on work experience
- If applying with promise of contract (means no contract yet, maybe just offer), then 10k EUR in savings
- Since this is intended for more than 1 year stay, it is a **national visa**
- The visa (once you obtain it) stamped on your passport will bear the properties
  - Two entries only, don't leave the country once you're in!
  - Valid for 120 days (the time to make residency application)
    - Though this can be extended by the government, since AIMA is overwhelmed with applications and has a backlog of 400K+ applications, [news post](https://worktugal.substack.com/p/portugal-immigration-documents-extension) about this. It was recently extended to one year for all those that posses the visa/documents.
- You may obtain citizenship in 5 years of residency

- `[EMBA]`: Indicated by the embassy
- `[GUID]`: Indicated by guides online

### Obtaining visa appointment

- Visa appointment is obtained from [E-visa platform](https://pedidodevistos.mne.gov.pt/VistosOnline/)
  - If you ever log in, don't forget to log out when you're done. **Because system allows only one active login session!** If you forget to logout and close the tab/window, then you may not login for some hours until your session is cleared.
  - The appointment date selection/change page can be opened once every 12 hours. So be very careful when you open it, once you navigate to another page or close it, you will not be able to open that page again for 12 hours.
  - It's a clunky system and will make you quite frustrated and nervous, be prepared.
  - Only the days from Monday to Thursday (inclusive) are available to be reserved, and for certain times.
- Swiftly obtain a visa appointment as soon as you have a confirmation or a binding document (contract, invitation letter etc.)
  - Because available appointments dates are usually so late
  - Last time I checked, there were free slots starting from 5 months from now
- Many countries other than Turkey may request appointment via VFS Global
- ~~Originally, you may request an appointment at the embassy via emailing this address `sconsular.ankara@mne.pt`, but now it is invalid.~~
- However, at the moment of writing (19/05/2024) embassy website indicates you may get appointment from the e-visa platform
  - https://pedidodevistos.mne.gov.pt/VistosOnline/
  - Interestingly, this announcement wasn't on the website a few days ago? Check the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230812092053/https://ancara.embaixadaportugal.mne.gov.pt/tr/konsolosluk-bolumu/genel-bilgi) for proof.
- `[RELO]` routes you to apply to e-visa first for appointment (and application form), then email the embassy for appointment
- In case of late appointment, or trouble getting any appointment at all. Consult your lawyers to kindly harass them a bit.
- Embassy in Ankara receives about 7k emails a day (learnt it first hand in the embassy), so it might be difficult to get a response by email

### Documents

- All documents must be in A4 size. For those documents bigger than A4, photocopy them into A4
- No paperclips, pins, folders (at the time of delivering the documents to the embassy)
- No lamination for any document
- **All documents** must be translated to English or Portuguese by a sworn translator. Although Portuguese is preferred, it could be processed faster.
- If you bring a photocopy of a document, bring the original as well
- If you're not sure where to get an apostille for a document, advise to the closest district governorship. They are responsible for applying apostille to documents. Apostilles are free of charge, don't forget that! Some translators might try to charge hefty sums for it.
- Establish a new, empty folder because there is going to be a throng of documents.
- Documents are separated into three categories, each category should be grouped in a file, contained in the folder. Files/categories follows as:
  - [File #1](#file-1): Documents to be handed to the consulate
  - [File #2](#file-2): Auxiliary documents, supportive material
  - [File #3](#file-3): Original documents and materials
- Once submitted, all documents **handed** to the consulate will be gone, cannot be retrieved regardless of the outcome. Only the passport will be given back to you.

  - It's not clear for the order of approvals and translations, Embassy has an ambiguous description. Some translators claim its the first(1), others claim its the second(2) order. For example, Italy expect the order 1 to be done, otherwise they don't recognize. For Portugal, there is no clear information. But the first one is more guaranteed to be accepted, it won't hurt. Just a little more expensive. Two possible orderings:

    2. Translation->Notary->Apostille

  - There are so many good comments on the security at the gate, people claim she is really helpful.
  - You'll be instructed to leave your belongings at the security, you'll be given a number/ticket to get them back
    - They only took electronics and ID card, nothing else
  - Security (in the premises, indoors security) will do the preliminary checks of your documents

  - Documents needs to be ordered per guideline, order them properly
- About the application form
  - Do not touch the right hand side column of the form, that is for the consulate to fill
  - Either fill a new form or do redaction on your existing form. Redaction is simply crossing the text/info with a line and writing a correct data
  - If you got the application form from e-visa, you'll have to alter certain sections, this is due to the fact that at the time of applying for visa appointment certain details and info might not be available (accommodation, travel date etc.)
    - I had to fill/alter (as far as I can recall): 
      - Fields about inviting company/temporary accommodation (section 30)

      - Home address (section 19) (was missing district and city)
      - Estimated arrival and estimated departure (section 27)

  - Consulate may ask details about your documents to cross validate you do know the details
  - They may also do small talks and chit-chats, I mean they are human beings after all
  - You might be prompted to have your photo taken if the photos you brought are not up to par with the standard. As well as fingerprints.
    - They took photos of every applicant, no fingerprint was taken
  - D3 visa application is subject to visa fee of €90 in local currency cash, bring sufficient banknotes and coins. Though they change if they have it.
  - Consul didn't ask specific documents or documents categories, he simply said: "give me the documents". So be prepared.
  - Overall it was a pleasant experience for me, they weren't rude or anything. Pretty easy going, actually. 

- You'll be asked how you want to receive back your passport:
  1. Via shipment to your address
     - You'll have to fill a UPS form. It is a carbon form with three copies. One copy is for you to keep, another is for the security, another is to be handed to the visa desk
     - On the UPS form, it is indicated you'll pay for the shipment on delivery, you won't make any payment for this during the application
     - It'll be delivered to the address in 2-3 business days once the application is concluded
  2. In person
     - You'll have to personally visit the embassy once more when it is concluded
