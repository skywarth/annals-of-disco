### Photo

This one is a bit controversial, apparently. Some say you may if you want, some say there is no need. I haven't concluded my thought on this one yet.

- These countries strongly advise against photo due to strict anti-discrimination acts and labour laws. Companies usually discard resumes with photos to prevent any possible lawsuits regarding discrimination or unfair hiring.

## ATS
Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is here to make it frustrating for applicants. Basically it's a software system that just scans the application as soon as it is uploaded. When a company has an ATS system, your resume/CV won't be displayed to an actual human being until it passes the ATS. So if you don't taylor it according to what the machine likes, it doesn't mean crap. No matter how fancy, how catchy it looks; it's gotta pass the ATS first.

Therefore, make sure your resume PDF has readable/selectable characters, and it doesn't look funky when a text is selected. PDF consisting of an image of resume content is a big no!
