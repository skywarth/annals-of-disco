## Ostrich problem

AKA Ostrich effect. It comes from the misconception that ostriches bury their hands into the ground to avoid any danger. In interpersonal relationships and informal contexts, people tend to avoid certain information or facts which might have negative implications on them. Such as refraining from checking your bank account balance, looking up facts that are otherwise surmised, getting cancer diagnosis/evaluation, checking up exam results. It is the embodiment of 'ignorance is a bliss'.




## XY Problem

AKA asking the wrong questions. Asking not the actual problem itself but rather asking/talking about your attempted solution, which naturally makes things far more complicated than they actually are.
