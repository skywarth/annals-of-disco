Damn... Should've started this list soo much earlier. Now how the hell am I supposed to callback all those great movies. 

- The Sword of Doom (has some crazy scowls. basically it's about an evil samurai)
- China syndrome
  - Reactor control room scene is really good
- Wargames
- men of honor (navy diver, De Niro)
- Requiem for a Dream (a bit emotional, meh)
- dog day afternoon (1975) (not bad, some scenes are fun)
- prey (predator 5) (so mediocre.)
- grave of the fireflies (hotaru no haka) (pretty good, bitter)
- crouching tiger, hidden dragon (great, kinda dull in some scenes. It's very similar to the movie "Hero")
- the island (meh it's ok nothing extraordinary. First 45 min is nice and interesting. 1/3 is sci-fi, 2/3 is classic action movie)
- soylent green (magnificent, especially the ending. Doesn't feel like a far future)
- surrogates (meta. Meh not so good)
- the running man (low quality, a bit boring)


### Watch later

- Empire Records
- Starship Troopers
- Crank 1 and 2
