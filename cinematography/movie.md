Damn... Should've started this list soo much earlier. Now how the hell am I supposed to callback all those great movies. 

- The Sword of Doom (has some crazy scowls. basically it's about an evil samurai)
- China syndrome
  - Reactor control room scene is really good
- Wargames
- men of honor (navy diver, De Niro)
- Requiem for a Dream (a bit emotional, meh)
- dog day afternoon (1975) (not bad, some scenes are fun)
- prey (predator 5) (so mediocre.)
- grave of the fireflies (hotaru no haka) (pretty good, bitter)
- crouching tiger, hidden dragon (great, kinda dull in some scenes. It's very similar to the movie "Hero")
- the island (meh it's ok nothing extraordinary. First 45 min is nice and interesting. 1/3 is sci-fi, 2/3 is classic action movie)
- soylent green (magnificent, especially the ending. Doesn't feel like a far future)
- surrogates (meta. Meh not so good)
- the running man (low quality, a bit boring)
- raid 1 (nice action movie, some really unnecessary details are present. Like dude you are an action movie, don't try too hard to have a plot. Close to gun-fu)
- sin city (incredible. Such artistic scenes and delivery. Fun and quality packed punch. Would recommend, probably will watch again. )
- Lethal Weapon (decent action movie from 80s. A bit dumb writing at times and strong plot armor but good representation of classic 80s action)
- Angel Heart (so thematic. I found it pretty close to 'Apocalypse Now' in some sense. I think it's a mix of 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Devils advocate' movies)
- Cobra (Meh, it's alright. Kinda dumb, like someone overdosed the movie with "80s action pack" but turned it to eleven. Usual stereotypical 80s action, has all the elements)
- red heat (1988) (lame. Arnold Schwarzenegger as russian cop)
- Beverly hills cop (1984) (Eddie Murphy. Ordinary police-action-comedy. Jonathan banks ? Whaaaaat ?? It's alright, watchable. Family friendly except a few scenes)
- one hour photo (2002) (It's alright, some scenes are stretched to dread and could be boring. Rather realistic slightly psycho movie. Robin Williams. Photo printer)
- Animatrix (Not good, only one or two stories are worth watching.)
- marathon man (It's OK, some scenes and elaborations are just too unnecessary, it doesn't even contribute to the story. Not an exceptional movie. Dustin Hoffman)
- Howl's Moving Castle (Magnificient, a classic from Hayao Miyazaki)
- Good Time (Alright movie, doesn't require your strict attention. Contains some decent comedy. Drug, theft... vice spree. Actually it is like crime speedrun)
- a single man (Suicidal homosexual man, psychological movie. Decent, not incredible. Focuses too damn much on romance and affairs.)
- The Rock (1996) (Ordinary action movie, some famous actors though. Nothing fancy. Island, alcatraz, marines go rogue, main characters go in and brrr. Nicolas Cage)
- Imperium (2016) (Undercover cop, supremacists and fascists. It's like bootleg version of American History X. It's not a must-watch, it's ok)
- All quiet on the western front (2022) (A realistic WW1 movie, visuals are great. Focuses on harsh realities of war, incompetent and corrupt rulers and brutalities of war. Not as good as the movie '1917' but still somewhat good)
- raid 2 (such try-hard for a story. Bro you're just some braindead action movie just do your thing. Other than that it's ok. Not as good as the first one.)
- Empire Records (Vinyl store, group of teens working as clerk. I usually hate musicals maybe it is the reason but I really found it wexing. Unreasonable character developments, so many loop-holes in the story, unnecessary dialogues. Wouldn't really recommend. It could be that I just didn't understand it.)
- House of Flying Daggers (2004) (Some sort of emotional movie. Some scenes resembles of the movie 'Hero'. Love is the main theme. Found it boring. Dunno wasn't so appealing to me. Plot was sligtly hard to grasp.)
- platoon (1986) (war movie, war crimes, Vietnam, some famous actors. good movie, don't be fooled by the dullness of the first 30 min)
- Crank 1 and 2 (classic 2000s action movie, enjoyable and fun. wish there was a third. Concept is interesting)
- Mongol (2007) (Genghis Khan, story is well explained. Some mystic elements is in place. Can be slightly boring though, nonetheless decent movie)
