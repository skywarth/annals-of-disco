Damn... Should've started this list soo much earlier. Now how the hell am I supposed to callback all those great movies. 

- The Sword of Doom (has some crazy scowls. basically it's about an evil samurai)
- China syndrome
  - Reactor control room scene is really good
- Wargames



### Watch later
- Starship Troopers
- men of honor
