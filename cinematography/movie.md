Damn... Should've started this list soo much earlier. Now how the hell am I supposed to callback all those great movies. 

- The Sword of Doom (has some crazy scowls. basically it's about an evil samurai)
- China syndrome
  - Reactor control room scene is really good
- Wargames
- men of honor (navy diver, De Niro)
- Requiem for a Dream (a bit emotional, meh)
- dog day afternoon (1975) (not bad, some scenes are fun)
- prey (predator 5) (so mediocre.)
- grave of the fireflies (hotaru no haka) (pretty good, bitter)
- crouching tiger, hidden dragon (great, kinda dull in some scenes. It's very similar to the movie "Hero")
- the island (meh it's ok nothing extraordinary. First 45 min is nice and interesting. 1/3 is sci-fi, 2/3 is classic action movie)
- soylent green (magnificent, especially the ending. Doesn't feel like a far future)
- surrogates (meta. Meh not so good)
- the running man (low quality, a bit boring)
- raid 1 (nice action movie, some really unnecessary details are present. Like dude you are an action movie, don't try too hard to have a plot. Close to gun-fu)
- sin city (incredible. Such artistic scenes and delivery. Fun and quality packed punch. Would recommend, probably will watch again. )
- Lethal Weapon (decent action movie from 80s. A bit dumb writing at times and strong plot armor but good representation of classic 80s action)
- Angel Heart (so thematic. I found it pretty close to 'Apocalypse Now' in some sense. I think it's a mix of 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Devils advocate' movies)
- Cobra (Meh, it's alright. Kinda dumb, like someone overdosed the movie with "80s action pack" but turned it to eleven. Usual stereotypical 80s action, has all the elements)
- red heat (1988) (lame. Arnold Schwarzenegger as russian cop)
- Beverly hills cop (1984) (Eddie Murphy. Ordinary police-action-comedy. Jonathan banks ? Whaaaaat ?? It's alright, watchable. Family friendly except a few scenes)
- one hour photo (2002) (It's alright, some scenes are stretched to dread and could be boring. Rather realistic slightly psycho movie. Robin Williams. Photo printer)
- Animatrix (Not good, only one or two stories are worth watching.)
- marathon man (It's OK, some scenes and elaborations are just too unnecessary, it doesn't even contribute to the story. Not an exceptional movie. Dustin Hoffman)
- Howl's Moving Castle (Magnificient, a classic from Hayao Miyazaki)
- Good Time (Alright movie, doesn't require your strict attention. Contains some decent comedy. Drug, theft... vice spree. Actually it is like crime speedrun)
- a single man (Suicidal homosexual man, psychological movie. Decent, not incredible. Focuses too damn much on romance and affairs.)
- The Rock (1996) (Ordinary action movie, some famous actors though. Nothing fancy. Island, alcatraz, marines go rogue, main characters go in and brrr. Nicolas Cage)
- Imperium (2016) (Undercover cop, supremacists and fascists. It's like bootleg version of American History X. It's not a must-watch, it's ok)
- All quiet on the western front (2022) (A realistic WW1 movie, visuals are great. Focuses on harsh realities of war, incompetent and corrupt rulers and brutalities of war. Not as good as the movie '1917' but still somewhat good)
- raid 2 (such try-hard for a story. Bro you're just some braindead action movie just do your thing. Other than that it's ok. Not as good as the first one.)
- Empire Records (Vinyl store, group of teens working as clerk. I usually hate musicals maybe it is the reason but I really found it wexing. Unreasonable character developments, so many loop-holes in the story, unnecessary dialogues. Wouldn't really recommend. It could be that I just didn't understand it.)
- House of Flying Daggers (2004) (Some sort of emotional movie. Some scenes resembles of the movie 'Hero'. Love is the main theme. Found it boring. Dunno wasn't so appealing to me. Plot was sligtly hard to grasp.)
- platoon (1986) (war movie, war crimes, Vietnam, some famous actors. good movie, don't be fooled by the dullness of the first 30 min)
- Crank 1 and 2 (classic 2000s action movie, enjoyable and fun. wish there was a third. Concept is interesting)
- Mongol (2007) (Genghis Khan, story is well explained. Some mystic elements is in place. Can be slightly boring though, nonetheless decent movie)
- sphere (1998) (watched it so many times during childhood. Soundtracks are great, plot is intriguing, characters and acting sucks balls (Even though some great actors are present ???), scene props were horrible. It's ok. Good time killer. Sci-fi movie.)
- virus (1999) (Some entity is beamed down from the satellite, which just learns and upgrades itself, aims to destroy humans. Bootleg popcorn movie. Only the plot/story was fancy for a bit then became straight up boring. Just not good. Food movie)
- Screamers (1995) (Some kind of AI keeps learning and improves itself. Subterran, burrowing, flying-blade, screaming-arse, non-logical creatures. At some point it tries to resemble the movie 'Thing' but ofc not even close. Main actor tried hard to carry it but the cast was a bit too heavy for that. Interesting story though. It's ok.)
- Once upon a time in west (1968) (Railroad, wild west. Cast and acting is great. But damn is it slow, it is soo far stretched. Contains usual scowls. Good but kinda boring) 
- Malcolm X (1992) (Strong political movie, biography, civil rights, 1960s period. Scenes just cut abruptly, I don't get it. Good movie, some memorable scenes for sure. Denzel played it great.)
- Django (1966) (Great western movie. Drifting a coffing on his back. One of a few occurrences of minigun/gatling gun in western movies. Mexicans, confederate soldiers. Heist.)
- mimic (1997) (Cockroach infestation, adaptation, massive cockroaches, sewers. Didn't enjoy it much, insignificant movie.)
- Blue Max (1966) (WW1 ace pilot, blue max ribbon, dogfight, unprecedented swagger of pilots, politics, sad ending. Good movie. Interactions between characters are hard to wrap your head around.)
- There will Be Blood (2007) (drilling, pumping oil, wild westish era, blinded by determination. Good movie.)
- Over The Top (Trucker dad, navy seal son, arm wrestling, and more 18 wheelers. Decent movie about family values and father-son relationships. Sylvester Stallone carried the movie.)
- Death Race (2008) (Low-tier shite action movie. Jason Statham. Prison, car race to death in order to win freedom. Watch it for the fun, some scenes are just awful hilarious.)
- omega man (1971) (Post-apocalyptic. Night people, mysterious disease, anti-techno society, cool-ass vampire lookin' people. This movie is the source of inspiration on the movie "I Am Legend (2007)". Masculine theme is strong similar to it's era. Great movie, plot kinda sucks but still nice.)
- An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) (Military movie. Some guy joins the army, hard training, drill instructor, loses friend to suicide, deceiving relationships. Good movie.)
- Boyz â€™N The Hood (1991) (Hood, ghetto, community, crime, felony, drive-by shooting, teaching son to be a man. Ok movie, except for a few subtle messages it's dull.)
- inferno (2016) (dante's inferno, amnesia, WHO, puzzle solving. It feels like a boring action movie. It's ok but you won't be missing much if you don't watch it.)
- Titan AE (2000) (Classic children animated movie. Decent animations for it's time, but CGIs suck. Protagonist has a map imprinted on his hand (by ring). Great film to watch with family, suggested especially for younglings.)
- Treasure Planet (2002) (Animated kids movie, but adults can watch as well. Has some fantastic characters with depth. Voice acting and body languages are impressive. Fun to watch.)
- Do the Right Thing (1989) (Interesting movie regarding racial issues, ghettos, empathy. Pizzaria, Italians, Asians, Afro-americans. Fun movie.)
- The Day of the Jackal (1973) (Pretty good. Basically a cat-mouse game between detective and an assasin. France, forged identity, assasination plot, know-how.)
- Swordfish (2001) (John Travolta, Hugh Jackman. Heist, infamous hacker, hacking, corruption. Finally a movie where antoganist wins, damn. Plot twist is strong. Good movie. Even though hacking scenes were so far fetched, I enjoyed it.) 
- Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) (Meh, it's alright. Visuals are great.)
- Army of darkness (1992) (Famous "boom stick" scene is from this movie. Time travel, medieval, shotgun, skeletons, necromancers... Not a 'must watch', meh. It's good as a meal movie or watch-with-friends movie though. Fun elements are always present but quite forced imo)
- Turkey shoot (1982) (A classical hyper-violence movie. R@p3, murder, manslaughter, it's all there. Basically a dystopian future where divergent people are sent to camps for re-education camps. Then the elite arrive occasionally to hunt the prisoners in a hunting game. Fun movie.)
- Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023) (Fun movie with DnD theme, duh. It's good, visuals are nice. CGI is a bit too much but whatever. Not bad at all.)
- Sicario (2015) (Glorified drug bust action movie IMHO, I don't really see the point what makes it a good movie. Meh, decent action, actors did a real good job though. Cartel, drug, three letter boys, corruption, vengance. Mediocre.)
- margin call (2011) (Fire scale scene that lasts 10-15 min is good, rest is insignificant. Good movie. Every boss, manager, leader should watch. Tough decisions, firing people, company bankrupting, corporate culture, mega-corp.)
- jarhead (2005) (Army movie. It's okay. Decent food movie.)
- The talented Mr. Ripley (1999) (Magnificent, Magnificient!.. Manipulation, impersonation, identity theft, crime spree, homosexuality, forgery, Italy, America. Great actors, great acting, great story. )
- Nocturnal Animals (2016) (Glorified messy divorce movie. Guy writes a book about; a man and his family is harassed, then all except husband is m*rdered. Revenge story. Ending is debatable, not clear. Great acting though and characters though. It's ok.)
- The Northman (2022) (Great one. A lot of folklore, symbolism, shamanism is inplace. Psychological at certain scenes. At times it reminded me of Lighthouse(2019). Vengeance, revenge, nordic, vikings, medieval.)
- Mr Brooks (2007) (Psycho, alter ego, businessman in the day murderer by night. Some details were really unnecessary, it wouldn't affect the movie slightest if we cut like 15-20 min of scenes. It's decent.)
- The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) (With this story and actors, it could've been so much better. Sean Connery tried to lift the movie's quality but it was so heavy. Group of gifted people, hunting a arms-dealer which'll start world war. Incredibly bland, boring and predictable. Meh.)
- Gone girl (2014) (Psycho woman, pyschopathy, scheming, faking death/kidnapping, framing with murder. It's alright, kinda interesting. But rather predictable.)
- Machinist (2004) (It's been so long since i watched this. Insomnia, schizophrenia. Really good movie, must watch I would say.)
- Bronson (2008) (Bri'ish. Boxer, asylum, prison life, sociopath. Narrative. Decent, interesting. )
- Seven Psychopaths (2012) (Basically a guy writing a story book about seven psychos. Comedy-oriented. Famous actors present. It's meh)
- Violence Jack (1990) (So uhhh... Hyper-violence galore. Anime with 3 episodes. A lot of no-no's present: r*pe, murder, torture, manslaughter, gang-violence, looting. It's pretty good. Be careful, it is extremely obscene and nasty. Best one is Hell City - Evil Town. )
- Fugitive (1993) (A doctor accused of murdering his wife, on the run to prove them wrong. It's OK, nothing special)
- The Gentlemen (2019) (Great narrative. Some scenes reminded me of 'Snatch' and 'Lock stock and two smoking barrels'. Drug lord, high-end deals, schemes, more schemes and some comedy. Decent movie.)
- Gangs of New York(2002) (1800s New York, gangs, crime, syndicate, army draft, gang wars. Some well-known actors are present. Didn't like it whole a lot. It's rather weak.)
- Coherence (2013) (Pretty good mind-twist, barely sci-fi. A comment passes and the whole neighborhood is now co-existing with their parallels from alternate realities. Good movie.)
- Primer (2004) (My expectations were really high for this one, since many people suggested it. It was a giant flop and a let-down. First 30-45min are fine and all technical, but after that some new plot unravels and confuses the sh*t out of you, I didn't grasp the whole thing to be honest. Most of the time i was lost. Maybe I'll give it another try later. Extremely boring. Not good.)
- American Assasin (2017) (Truly a terrible movie. "GF gets killed by baddies, imma bulk up, imma be mad, imma be vengeful, imma kill baddies". Even acting sucks. There are one or two well-known actors but even they couldn't carry this clusterf*ck. Don't waste your time.)
- The Bothersome Man (2006) (Main idea is decent. Execution and atmosphere is subpar. Ending is terrible. Meh movie.)
- Collateral (2004) (Classic 2000s action movie. Nothing exceptional. Food movie.)
- Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003) (Navy, Napoleon era, seamen, naval wars, commandship. Good movie about leadership and hard choices. Nice one)
- Equalizer 3 (2023) (Full of cliche. Plot is lame. Action scenes are decent. Couldn't hold a damn candle to it's predecessors. Generic action movie about a vigilante.)
- The Ninth Gate (1999) (Kingdom of Shadows book, aka Ninth Gate. Book collector. Theological stuff. Johnny Depp. Achieving great power through rituals. Satanism. It's ok)
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005) (Terrible, couldn't wait for it to end. Really lame comedy.)
- Deathstalker (1983) (Good ol' 70s/80s action RPG hero centric, hyperviolence filled, nuditity containing movie. Pretty bad. Three artifact of power: sword, amulet, chalice. Villain, hero, usual drill.)
- Heat (1995) (De Niro, Al Pacino. Affair, heist, bank heist, incredible action scenes, determination. Great movie.)
- Ghost in the shell (1995) (Neo Tokyo, Noir, dystopia, cyberpunk. Identity crisis, AI. It's a classic.)
- Cell (2000) (Jennifer Lopez, trauma, psychology, subconcious, psycho, dreams and nightmares, shared subconcious. Good one but not great for sure)
- Batman Begins (2005) (It's ok. Scarecrow, ra's al ghul, first Batman)
- born on the fourth of july (1989) (Army veteran abandoned by the government, classic. Patriot turning lib and abandoning his old ideals. War movie. Anti-gov movie.)
- The Conversation (1974) (Paranoia. Wire-tapping, listening phones and conversations. Early signal processing and audio engineering. Raising awareness on infosec.)
- Ben-Hur (1959) (Jesus of Nazareth, Judah Ben-hur, Judaism, Jerusalem, Roman Empire, vengance, redemption. Pretty good, boring at times. Some spiritual themes are just a bit too forced.)
- Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) (Un-memorable, easily forgotten. Only shadow realm sequence is aight. Only watched it for Christian Bale, which was the only one that did a decent job. Whole story, plot, CGI and animations are terrible. Food movie) 
- Good Burger (1997) (Burger place, competition, secret sauce, kids movie, bunch of fools. Its a kids movie. Incredibly stupid and boring. Hard skip.)
- Saturday Night Fever (1977) (Dance-off, 70s Disco, Italian-american life, suburbs, low-life lifestyle, love, drama, Travolta. Decent movie, Travolta was alright. Why is it such a emotion rollercoaster, kinda depressing actually. Ending was weird. Yeah it is depressing. Incredible dance moves tho. Decent.)
- guardians of the galaxy vol 3 (2023) (Heavily focused on emotional side, but kinda fails to deliver it. So many forced jokes, so many plotholes that have no contribution to the story. You may easily cut 30-40 min content and story would stay identical. It's a generic action movie. But good as a binge eating movie.)
