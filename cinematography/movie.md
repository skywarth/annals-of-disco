Damn... Should've started this list soo much earlier. Now how the hell am I supposed to callback all those great movies. 

- The Sword of Doom (has some crazy scowls. basically it's about an evil samurai)
- China syndrome
  - Reactor control room scene is really good
- Wargames
- men of honor (navy diver, De Niro)
- Requiem for a Dream (a bit emotional, meh)
- dog day afternoon (1975) (not bad, some scenes are fun)
- prey (predator 5) (so mediocre.)
- grave of the fireflies (hotaru no haka) (pretty good, bitter)
- crouching tiger, hidden dragon (great, kinda dull in some scenes. It's very similar to the movie "Hero")
- the island (meh it's ok nothing extraordinary. First 45 min is nice and interesting. 1/3 is sci-fi, 2/3 is classic action movie)
- soylent green (magnificent, especially the ending. Doesn't feel like a far future)
- surrogates (meta. Meh not so good)
- the running man (low quality, a bit boring)
- raid 1 (nice action movie, some really unnecessary details are present. Like dude you are an action movie, don't try too hard to have a plot. Close to gun-fu)
- sin city (incredible. Such artistic scenes and delivery. Fun and quality packed punch. Would recommend, probably will watch again. )
- Lethal Weapon (decent action movie from 80s. A bit dumb writing at times and strong plot armor but good representation of classic 80s action)
- Angel Heart (so thematic. I found it pretty close to 'Apocalypse Now' in some sense. I think it's a mix of 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Devils advocate' movies)
- Cobra (Meh, it's alright. Kinda dumb, like someone overdosed the movie with "80s action pack" but turned it to eleven. Usual stereotypical 80s action, has all the elements)
- red heat (1988) (lame. Arnold Schwarzenegger as russian cop)
- Beverly hills cop (1984) (Eddie Murphy. Ordinary police-action-comedy. Jonathan banks ? Whaaaaat ?? It's alright, watchable. Family friendly except a few scenes)
- one hour photo (2002) (It's alright, some scenes are stretched to dread and could be boring. Rather realistic slightly psycho movie. Robin Williams. Photo printer)
### Watch later

- Crank 1 and 2
- there will be blood (2007)

- Lethal Weapon 2,3,4
