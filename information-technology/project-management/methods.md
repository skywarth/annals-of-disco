## Six Thinking Hats


> The 6 Thinking Hats technique, developed by Edward de Bono, is a structured method for group discussion and individual thinking.
It involves six metaphorical hats, each representing a different type of thinking. Each hat has a different color to help you remember the type of thinking involved.
Participants switch hats to explore different perspectives, leading to more comprehensive decision making and problem solving.
