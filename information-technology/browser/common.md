### Version crisis
All major browsers are currently on two-digit version. Firefox 98, Chromemium 90-ish something. So in a few updates they will have a three-digit version number. But there are claims that web servers, js, and partially css expects two-digit version numbers. So web might break when it happens. I don't think anything major will happen, probably gonna be like Y2K.
