# Software Licence
*Yes indeed you are able to produce software but would it matter if you do not licence it properly ?* 

*This is where a hunchback code-dweller and a gentlemen differ. One day supreme-court shall summon you for assisting [-----] (it is because they used your FOSS library), if you set your licence wrong.*

## Open Source

Main authority for open source is: Open Source initiative. And it is run by board of directors. Not that it's an official authority but it's something.

For a software to be open source: **source code should be publicly accessible**. Fellas at the OSI (Open Source initiative) disagree with this definition. In their definition:
- Free to redistribute 
- Accessible source code
- Free to use

Well the thing is... OSI's definition is actually for FOSS (free open-source software) not open source. There is a big-ass line in between. I don't agree with their definition, but aside from certain clauses it's alright.




### MIT
"It’s basically like saying take my piece of code/project, do whatever you want (commercially/non-commercially) but don’t blame me if anything goes wrong"

Whatever you want includes: they take and alter the code, implement it in their system. And release it as a part of proprietary software. They can even take the code and release it for commercial use as it is. Kinda crazy.

### GNU General Public License (GPL) v3.0

*If you deriver an open source, it should be open source.*

Similar to MIT, except it doesn't allow the consumer to change the licence. In other words: if released under GPL v3, stays under GPL (v3). So in essence, it is one of the most open-source licence ever. It forces copies/forks to keep up the GPL licence so they also produce open-source. It's pretty contagious. Therefore big-corpo hates it.

### Apache License 2.0

Some witch craft. As Fantastic once said: "Man I don't even know, it's crazy.". I guess in essence it is "do whatever you wan't, don't sue me."

### FreeBSD / BSD 2-Clause License
Similar to MIT

### New BSD License / BSD 3-Clause

Similar to BSD 2, difference is they can't use the project's name nor contributer(s) name. Good way of staying low.

### Mozilla Public Licence



## Proprietary
What, licence for proprietary ? Haven't heard that term in years.
