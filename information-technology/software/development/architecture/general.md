### Module levels/layers:
- High level module: Those closer to the business functions
- Low level module: Those that deal with details. Such as DB queries etc.
- But it all boils down to the perspective you look at them. If you display it in widest scope possible, some modules in the middle could be both high and low level module. Basically it's not absolute, it's relative.
