## Commands (Artisan console)

- DO NOT EXIT THE COMMAND WITH `EXIT(0)` OR `EXIT(1)`. It messes up unit tests big time. Just use `return 0` for the love of god. It costed me around 3 hours.


## Events

There are events and observers/listeners. Listeners subscribe to event(s) and do actions. Events fire when certain things happen, you fire it explicitly. 

Events and listeners registered in `EventServiceProvider`.

### Generating event and listener fiels

`php artisan event:generate` looks up into the `EventServiceProvider`, creates events and listeners classes accordingly. But this one does the folder structure uglier. So i don't recommend it. It stores both the event and the listener in providers folder ðŸ¤¢

Or you may use:

`php artisan make:event PodcastProcessed` and `php artisan make:listener SendPodcastNotification --event=PodcastProcessed`. Remember to register these into the `EventServiceProvider` !

You are not obliged to create listener classes, you can register them anonymously into the `boot()` function of an event.

### Events
- You can add as many properties as you want. Then you can indicate these dependencies and parameters in constructor.

### Listeners
- Listeners receive event instances in the handle method `public function handle(OrderShipped $event)`. But you don't have to explicitly indicate type, you may just apply loose-type. `public function handle($event)`
- You may type-hint any necessary dependency and service in handle parameters to inject it through service container

#### Queuing
- Useful when you are going to perform time-consuming tasks in the **Listener**.
- Configure your queue in queue.php and start queue workers by either `queue:work` or `queue:listen`. (Don't forget to indicate the queue in work/listen !)
- If a listener is going to run on queue, implement `shouldQueue` interface on the listener clas.
- `public $connection = 'some-queue-for-events';` This refers to an entry in `queue.connections.some-queue-for-events` in `queue.php`. If you don't declare/define anything about connection in listener, it will use the default queue connection `'default'` from `queue.php`.
- `public $queue = 'lets-gooo';` this one is for overriding `'queue'=>'....'` in queue definition of corresponding queue connection. For example:
    ```
    //content of queue.php
    'connections'=>[
            'some-queue-for-events' => [
                    'driver' => 'redis',
                    'connection' => 'default',
                    'queue' => 'my-queue',
                    'retry_after' => 90,
                    'block_for' => null,
                    'after_commit' => false,
                ],
        ....
    ```
    So in this case your listener will actually run on `lets-gooo` queue rather than `my-queue` because you're simply overriding it.


### Misc

#### Queueable anonymous listener
you may use:
```
Event::listen(queueable(function (PodcastProcessed $event) {
        //
    }))->onConnection('redis')->onQueue('podcasts')->delay(now()->addSeconds(10)))
    ->catch(function (PodcastProcessed $event, Throwable $e) {
    // The queued listener failed...
}));
```
In a boot method of an event to register an anonymous (has no listener file) that runs using `queue` driver.

#### Wildcard event listener (anonymous)
```
Event::listen('event.*', function ($eventName, array $data) {
    //
});
```

#### Auto-discovery
I don't think it is a good future, can cripple performance a bit. Don't be a lazy-ass and define your events/listeners !

#### Production
Use `event:cache` on production to speed things up a bit. Clear 'em when you don't need 'em `event:clear`


#### Stop Event propagation
- **[!]** If you return false from handle method of a listener, it will stop propagation of the event.
