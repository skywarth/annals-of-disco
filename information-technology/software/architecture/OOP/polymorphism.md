# Polymorphism

Same interfaces applied (morph) for many different (poly) data types.

- Shared functionality
- Shared methods
- Shared application areas






Analogy examples: 
- `int` and `float` are technically polymorphic, because they provide the same set of operations and extensions, such as addition (`+`) and substraction (`-`)
- All sea creatures `swim()`, but they `swim()` in their own style. 
- Cafe's have hundreds of various drinks from hot to cold. But no matter what you choose, you always `drink()` it.



Use Cases:

`#1` Just Do It, I don't care how

```php
tba
```
