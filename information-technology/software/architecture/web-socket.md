- Has a protocol 'ws'. Like `ws://127.0.0.1`. Ayo what ?!
- In HTTP: request is sent, and server responds with a response. Then connection is terminated. WS is not like that
- Different from Long Polling. Long polling returns data in expected resource is not ready, e.g sleep(50). Then eventually responds and __closes__ the connection.
- Connection is persistent, does not terminate unless told otherwise
- Bi-directional
- Allows real time data flow
