- If you change hostname during installation or at some weird point, it may cause delay when issuing ```sudo``` on bash. Especially for starship shell. To fix this edit ```/etc/hosts```.
- If you want some global command to execute on terminal start (e.g open new terminal), add the command to the end of the ```.bashrc```
- ```nano ~/.bashrc```
