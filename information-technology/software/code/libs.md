## PDF Generate

### JS
1. PDFMake _//requires webpack_
2. PDFKit _//decent, fonts are problematic_
3. jsPDF _//module based (smh). But can get it to work in regular stuff. _ 
4. pdf-lib _//looking promising. Only drawback is everything must be calculated and positioned pixel by pixel._
5. LabelMake _//nice and easy. It is a new one. Currently free, hope it stays that way._
6. https://github.com/ovvn/dom-to-pdf *//Dayum, this looks hella easy to use. And also it is DOM to PDF. Will try on first occurence.*
