## Churlish
`chur-lish`

Act of being churl: beastly, uncivilized, vulgar, rude, peasant like. Someone who is acting unpleasant. For example, declining a kind invitation could be churlish. Or interrupting someone while they are telling you a story would be churlish. When metro arrives, if you don't allow people to get off first, that is churlish; uncivil. 

Comes from old English, evolved through the ages. Originally ceorlisc, then cherlish, to churlish. Pre 1000s. In old English, ceorl (churl) would mean peasant; lowest class of men. Initially it didn't mean anything bad, it was simply a class in caste. Only later on it evolved to identify someone vulgar and uncivil.

## Force Majeure
`force-meguere`

Superior force. Usually used in law/business context where the meaning varies slightly. In business or law context it means; powers or events out of control or interception, e.g: war, natural disaster, cataclysim where no party as at fault so no-one is to blame. 

In the cases of force majeure; any obligations, terms, agreements and desigations may be rendered invalid. So if you see this clause in a law/businesss context it means the disclaimer relieves themselves from any obligations and liabilities, since it is beyond their control. 

*...We do not enforce any extra shifts, unless it is paid and agreed upon by both parties. Though force majeure may require you to perform extra shifts outside any agreement or time schedule.*

*As our defense in the court, we will primarily focus on the force majeure aspect and use it to our advantage.*
