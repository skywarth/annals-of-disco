## Bikeshedding
`bike-shed-ing`

It comes from the [Parkinson's law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality). Law of triviality suggests that people in a group/organization often weight trivial issues more than the crucial problems. 

> Parkinson observed that a committee whose job is to approve plans for a nuclear power plant may spend the majority of its time on relatively unimportant but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bikeshed, while neglecting the design of the power plant itself, which is far more important but also far more difficult to criticize constructively.

Focusing on trivial concepts rather than the paramount issues.

Usually used in software industry.

To me, its a fallacy of incompetent managers and leaders. To diverge the attention from their incompetency, they focus on easy to tackle (and usually elementary) task. This effectively masks their impotence, but in the mean time enables the whole organization's undoing.

English origin, 1957

*Stop with the bikeshedding and get on with it!*

*Lads it's not my place to say this but I feel like we're bikeshedding here*


## Dossier
`do-si-ay`

Documents, files, papers which belong to certain subject. For example; military personnel documents of a single person bundled together, folder that contains your personal information, set of documents you give to the consulate for visa application. 

In Latin, *dos* means "back". Dossier is named so because when these documents were bundled together with a strap, they would usually bear a insignia/label on the back.

However; in old French, *dossiere* means back-strap or rather horse harness. It also makes sense because books, documents, files, folders and papers were used to be bundled together via a strap/harness. Hence the WinRAR logo...

French Origin, 1880.

*I know that about you, I've read your dossier*

*Under no circumstance this dossier is laid bare before another pair of eyes*

## Riveting
`ri-ve-ting`

Extraordinarily interesting, captivating.

Comes from the figurative meaning of hammering down 'rivets', so you gather attention.

## Churlish
`chur-lish`

Act of being churl: beastly, uncivilized, vulgar, rude, peasant like. Someone who is acting unpleasant. For example, declining a kind invitation could be churlish. Or interrupting someone while they are telling you a story would be churlish. When metro arrives, if you don't allow people to get off first, that is churlish; uncivil. 

Comes from old English, evolved through the ages. Originally ceorlisc, then cherlish, to churlish. Pre 1000s. In old English, ceorl (churl) would mean peasant; lowest class of men. Initially it didn't mean anything bad, it was simply a class in caste. Only later on it evolved to identify someone vulgar and uncivil.


*Insubordinate and churlish, pity...*

*Such churlish and rudent behaviour will get you nowhere*

## Wog
> [racial slur] [offensive]

`wog`

Deragotary term to refer to non-white skinned person; usually those of nubian, middle-eastern or southeast-asian descendency. In some context of street slang, it might refer to **anyone** that is foreigner, but commonly for the listed ethnicities.

Originally it ment `"a lower-class babu shipping clerk"`, babu meaning clerk with Indian origin. Later popularized and used by British soldiers during WW2, as a slang for arab or native indian (hindoo), in the context of laborer/servant. Some uncertainties revolve around its lexicography but strongest candidate for the word origin is "golliwog" (deragotary, offensive) from `The History of King Edward's Horse, 1921`.

1920, Britian.

*Get that wog out of here*

## Force Majeure
`force-meguere`

Superior force. Usually used in law/business context where the meaning varies slightly. In business or law context it means; powers or events out of control or interception, e.g: war, natural disaster, cataclysim where no party as at fault so no-one is to blame. 

In the cases of force majeure; any obligations, terms, agreements and desigations may be rendered invalid. So if you see this clause in a law/businesss context it means the disclaimer relieves themselves from any obligations and liabilities, since it is beyond their control. 

*...We do not enforce any extra shifts, unless it is paid and agreed upon by both parties. Though force majeure may require you to perform extra shifts outside any agreement or time schedule.*

*As our defense in the court, we will primarily focus on the force majeure aspect and use it to our advantage.*
