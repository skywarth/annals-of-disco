### Schamroth window test
User for diagnosing lung cancer or heart related problems. But usually lung cancer. It is basically checking if fingers are clubbed. Clubbed fingers point to heart or lung problems (usually about oxygen levels in blood)
1. Press your index fingers on each each other (nails will be touching and facing each other)
2. Try too see if there is a gap. Careful: **Diamond-shaped gap* 
    * If there is a gap/diamond shape, nothing to worry about
    * If no gap or widening gap to the tip of the finger; possible lung cancer. See an oncologist immediately.
