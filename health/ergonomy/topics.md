### Hand


#### Common
- [**must**] use Arthisis gloves / Wrist brace. Greatly helps with fatigues, carpal tunnel, joint rheumatism in finger.
- [**must**] Use some sort of wrist support pillow/pad on the point where your arm resides on the desk. E.g you rest your arm using your wrist on the desk, E.g2 you rest by your elbow. 
- If you reside your arms using elbows, know that it'll probably tire your gripes soon. Possibility depends on the engineering of the chair.

#### Dual Wield Keyboard (For Vim masters)
Definitely some split keyboard will do the trick.  


#### Keyboard and Mouse
- *Embrace the vim peasant*
- Wavy and arced keyboards are great
- Use vertical mouses
