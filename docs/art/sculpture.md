## Laoco√∂n and His Sons

Artists: Hagesandros (or Agesander), Polydoros, and Athenedoros
Date: (Ambiguous) 40-30 BC

 Such horror for a father to see his sons strangled and bit to death by serpents before his eyes, and the dire expression on his face; facing upwards with agony, despair, anguish, and regret. Remarkable.
