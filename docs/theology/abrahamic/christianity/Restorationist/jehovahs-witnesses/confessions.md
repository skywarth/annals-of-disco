# Confessions

There are huge communities regarding ex-JW members, all of which report alarming foul things. One of such communities are: 
- [exJW](https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/) sub-reddit.
- [jwfacts.com](jwfacts.com)

Following info I obtained from hear-say, confession videos, interviews, and public internet sources.

My gatherings on ***alleged*** foul practices of JW organization:
- It is an organization, not a religion. It's a business (or a ponzi) scheme. See Watchtower Organization, so called non-profit.
- Members are forced or insistently asked to
	- Donate monthly, through JW website or donation boxes in Kingdom Halls
	- Will their home and properties to the organization
	- These practices are also done through 'guilt tripping' and brainwashing through "forsaking worldly possessions"
	- Contribute their labor and efforts
- Child abuse
- Sexual abuse and scandals
- No national holidays or special days: birthdays, Halloween, father's day, Christmas. You're not allowed to celebrate any holidays.
- "Two witness rule"
	- You need two witnesses to prove something to be true
- You're not encouraged to get education or get a high-end job, since that would make you cling to worldly endeavors
- Why and how is Watchtower organization is so rich? Rich as in billions of $
- Demonizing and denouncing former members
