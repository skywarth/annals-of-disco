# Lent

It is a common practice in *almost* all denominations of Christianity. Though certain aspect vary in each. But the main principle and the idea remains identical: fasting physically and spiritually to reminiscence of the event; Jesus spent 40 days in the desert and has endured temptations by Satan during that period. According to gospels of Matthew and Luke, this was prior to Jesus beginning his public ministry.


- It is observed prior to Easter
- Penitence includes fasting and abstaining from certain habits
- It is encouraged to do charity (alms-giving) in this period
- In ancient times, it was practices by wearing sackcloth and being peppered with ash
- Centuries ago, lent was observed far more strictly:
	- One meal a day
	- Meat, fish, eggs and butter are forbidden
		- Eastern churches also forbid the consumption & usage of wine, oil and any dairy products
	- These still apply even today in eastern churches
- Physical fasting is meaningless if it is not accompanied by spiritual fasting, abstaining from sin
- In essence, it is preparation for celebrating Jesus's resurrection in Easter
