# Old testament (Hebrew Bible)

## Chapters, stories & passages

### Account of Samuel, Saul and David

- Saul was the first crowned king (monarch) of the Israelites
  - Certain sources name it as king/prophet though I don't think it reflects it correctly 
- As years passed, Saul became corrupt, deranged and malignant. He forgot the ways of the Lord. Just as Samuel anticipated.
- Following yet another dispute with Saul regarding Lords demands and religious matters, Samuel left Saul in search of a new King of Israelites.


#### Coronation of Saul
- Israelites demanded a king from God, they plead to Samuel (prophet at the period) to relay this to God.
  - The reason was Samuel was guiding the Israelites through the years and has gotten old, and death would eventually catch up to him
  - Though Samuel proclaimed his sons would take his place and guide their people, tribe protested. Because it was well-known that sons of Samuel (Joel and Abijah) are unworthy, untrustworthy, corrupt and infamous.
  - Samuel warned the people that kings (monarchs) become tyrants, that they enslave and exploit their own people.
- Samuel consulted this subject with God, which in return resulted in Gods decree that there shall be a king of Israelites. And named the king as 'Saul'.
- For coronation ceremony, Samuel poured olive oil on Saul's head, kissed him and anointed him as King of Israelites by reciting the words:
  - >"The Lord has chosen you to lead his people Israel! You will rule over the Lordâ€™s people and you will deliver them from the power of the enemies who surround them. This will be your sign that the Lord has chosen you as leader over his inheritance." [src](https://yebc.net/yebc-study-bible/old-testament/1-samuel/654-1-samuel-10-king-saul-s-coronation)
