### Bifanas
- It's just a pork steak between two pieces of bread. Yeah, that's about it. Obviously it has some additional ingredients but it's as simple as that. But for the love of God, why no seasoning man?? Either way, it's delicious.

### Pasteis de Bacalhau
- Some sort of croquet looking pastry, contains Bacalhau in paste form inside, along with some other stuff. Tastes good.

### Bacalhau à Brás
Brás-style cod, codfish dish.

### Francesinha
A special Portuguse sandwich dish

### Caldo Verde

A pun of a name for Cape Verde.

The green soup. Kale, sausage, garlic, onion, potato, chicken stock

### Natas do Ceu

So called "Heaven cream", pretty good. Even store-bought one's are pretty decent

### Baba de Camelo
`dessert`

It means "Camel's drool". It's a mousse, but Portuguese version of it, very similar to the original one. Though I think I like this one more. It tastes so good. Has milk and eggs, so kinda healthy in a way.
