# Pros & Cons

## Pros

- Pivo. The best pivo (beer) in the world
- Small country with relatively small population, so less people per square meter
- Language is rather good to learn because it effectively enables you to communicate with neighboring countries and similar languages (Poland, Slovakia etc)
- Incredible nature and landscapes
- Decent prices all around
- Thrift shops, let's gooo! Coat for 2 EUR.
- Marvelous railroad infrastructure
- Has a cool flag

## Neutral

- People are rather reserved about meeting/talking with foreigners, no matter the nationality

## Cons

- Uses CZK instead of EUR
- English literacy is very limited, especially in rural areas. Sometimes people refuse to speak it even though they understand it.
