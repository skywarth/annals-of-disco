### Preperation
Before you beging preparing your CV/resume right away, you must prepare your accomplishments beforehand. This'll help you decide what you'll be putting in the resume. This is especially true if you have long list of remarkable accomplishments, or years of experience.

- Prepare list of accomplishments for each company/workplace/project you worked on
	- It is imperative you separate it this way, otherwise it can get real messy to keep track of
	- If you've taken multiple roles in the company (promotions through years, beginning as intern then up to manager etc. Or maybe you worked as both a sales person and a manager at the same time.), Then you split it once more per responsibility category. Beware it is not strictly role, it is also be responsibility or aspects.
- List those which are remarkable, kinda remarkable, looks good in numbers. No need for indistinguishable errands. Explain it in summary of details. Preferably one short paragraph. If it is some ground-breaking achievement then you may span up to 2 paragraphs tops. For each accomplishment/achievement/project make sure to include these
	- What was so challenging ? What makes it remarkable ? How did <ins> **it develop you ?** <ins> What have you learned from it, was there any lessons to be learned in that occurrence ?
  - *The numbers mason, it's always we ever wanted.* Numbers are scalar, palpable, comparable. In business we like things we can compare. In other words **<ins>quantifiable RULES<ins>**, **<ins>qualifiable<ins> SUCKS**. Don't believe me ? Consider for yourself, which of these phrases reflect better on you.
    - Succesfully integrated many new merchants from across the world.
    - Successfully integrated over 1500+ new merchants, ranging from mesopotamia to indochina region with the total of 24 countries added to the inventory.
    
	As you can see, the answer is clear as a day. We want comparable metrics: measurable, perceptible, assessable. This enables the possible resume reviewer to imagine your achievement in their mind.

#### Photo

This one is a bit controversial, apparently. Some say you may if you want, some say there is no need. I haven't concluded my thought on this one yet.

- These countries strongly advise against photo due to strict anti-discrimination acts and labour laws. Companies usually discard resumes with photos to prevent any possible lawsuits regarding discrimination or unfair hiring.

## ATS
Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is here to make it frustrating for applicants. Basically it's a software system that just scans the application as soon as it is uploaded. When a company has an ATS system, your resume/CV won't be displayed to an actual human being until it passes the ATS. So if you don't taylor it according to what the machine likes, it doesn't mean crap. No matter how fancy, how catchy it looks; it's gotta pass the ATS first.

Therefore, make sure your resume PDF has readable/selectable characters, and it doesn't look funky when a text is selected. PDF consisting of an image of resume content is a big no!
