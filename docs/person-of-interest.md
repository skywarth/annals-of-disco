## Tech savvy

- Richard Harrison
	- AKA: `zaretto`
	- https://chateau-logic.com/ (shutdown around 2024)
		- Original quote from the site: "A tranquil haven away from the hustle and bustle of pressured modern life, development is performed in a small stone room in the corner. The only fortifications are the firewalls, and the stone walls, just enough to think creatively. Here I ponder the intricacies of coding, sometimes complex distributed systems, othertimes the more mundane, and in my spare time the personal coding and pet projects. You don't have to like it."
		- Yet another quote from the site: "I've been developing software (or programming as we used to call it) since 1982, in the rough order: Basic -> 6502 assembler -> APL -> Pascal -> C -> C++ , and ending up with Java, C# and PHP. The last three are my preferred languages, the choice depends on the requirements of any given task. Add in database design and the ability to write efficient SQL."
