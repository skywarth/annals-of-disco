### Charcoal water (Activated charcoal)

#### Preperation 
1. Powderize the charcoal. Has to be just like talc powder. You may use blender.
2. Filter it through the sieve, you want only the powder not other big parts.
3. At this point it should look like grinded coffee, smooth and small particles.
4. Now to activate: use acid based liquid if possible. Lemon juice etc. Water is fine too. Mix your powdered charcoal with the liquid. Even if you have acid based liquid, you still need to include water.
5. Distill the mix, get rid of the liquid. We want whats left on top of distillation, the solid part.
6. Time to dry the whatever is left from distillation. Spread the leftover from distill into a flat surface. Either dry it in a oven, sunlight or something similar.
7. At the end you should have charcoal that feels and looks like dirt. Now you have activated charcoal powder.

New York City Department of health banned it in 2018, it is prohibited to use it as food coloring.
