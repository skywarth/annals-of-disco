> **Incredibly likely, almost certainly.**

### Sigma levels

- 1-sigma: around 68.27% likelihood of expected outcome, leaves a margin for high levels of undesired outcomes
- 2-sigma: around 95.45% likelihood of expected outcome, relatively small margin of defects
- 3-sigma: around 99.73% likelihood of expected outcome, used across the industries for baseline quality control measurement standard.
- 4-sigma: around 99.9937% likelihood of expected outcome
- 5-sigma: about 99.99994% likelihood of expected outcome, tight margin for error, used in safety-critical subject and industries with high precision, means almost no room for error. 1 defect/error in 3.4 million. It is so precise and extremely intolerant to fault; usually can be observed to be used in particle physics and similar areas.

## Bacchanalia

`bach-ana-lia`

> Drunken feast, orgy. An accustom of Romans

Some sort of Roman festival from Roman times of BC. It's nature is rather suggestive, ecstatic and *quite fun*. Horny masses, rituals and rites of all sorts, wine flowing like river, dance, music... It was exclusive to the cult of **Bacchus**. Even by Roman standards, they were considered inappropriate and degenerate. It gets the inspiration from **Bacchus**; god of wine, festivity, ritualistic frenzy and ecstasy.

You may simply think it as the moments before God smites thee; just before Moses descended back from the mountain, carrying with him **the commandments**. At that time, the general mass/crowd were also in some sort of trance of rave and fervor of degeneracy.
