## 5-sigma

The term sigma comes from the science statistics. It is used to define range of likelihood of an event occurring.

> **Incredibly likely, almost certainly.**

### Sigma levels

- 1-sigma: around 68.27% likelihood of expected outcome, leaves a margin for high levels of undesired outcomes
- 2-sigma: around 95.45% likelihood of expected outcome, relatively small margin of defects
- 3-sigma: around 99.73% likelihood of expected outcome, used across the industries for baseline quality control measurement standard.
- 4-sigma: around 99.9937% likelihood of expected outcome
- 5-sigma: about 99.99994% likelihood of expected outcome, tight margin for error, used in safety-critical subject and industries with high precision, means almost no room for error. 1 defect/error in 3.4 million. It is so precise and extremely intolerant to fault; usually can be observed to be used in particle physics and similar areas.
