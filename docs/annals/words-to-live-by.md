# Words to live by

Here is a list of great quotes, advices and words to live by. Some I learned the hard way, some I was advised beforehand, and some I am still to learn. 

Think on each and every one of them for a while, pause after you read them. Think on it, and look into your heart, reflect on yourself. It'll be for the best.

Some I devised myself, some are from; movies, tv shows, books, novels, articles, a stranger on the internet, a nemesis, or a wise old man on top of a mountain. 

1. > "You never open your mouth, until you know what the shot is."
2. > "If you're going to kill something, kill it good. Or else it will come crawling back from the dead and won't make the same mistake that you did."
3. > "You can't help those who can't help themselves."
