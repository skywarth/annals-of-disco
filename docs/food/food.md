## Canned food

### Spam

- Made from processed ham and ground pork
- Has high sodium and fat. Sodium nitrite to be specific
- Only has low amounts of protein, unlike general assumption
- Contains quite a lot of preservatives, hence the long shelf life
- Don't ever eat it with salt, it already contains bucket load of it
- Survival/struggle food, don't get confused. In north america, it is associated with what poor people eat, and people would wish you have better days ahead

#### Conclusion
- Considering the ingredients of it; it can lead to high blood pressure and increased chance of cancer. Carcinogen basically.
- Stay away from it. If you really want to eat, minimize the intake. Once or twice at most, per week.
