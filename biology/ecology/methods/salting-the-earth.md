# Salting the earth

Also known as sowing salt. It is an ancient practice of sowing salt to the ground in order to prevent growth of agricultural products and cultivation. It basically kills the land for a sustained period of time. Historically, it was applied to conquered lands in order to further cripple the local population's means of sustenance and perhaps force them to migrate away. As in it's meaning, it conveys the idea to none shall rise from this land, utter destruction.

Historically:
- Romans salted the lands of Carthage (not proven)
- Shechem was salted by an Israelite judge called Abimelech, as written in Book of Judges 9:45 in Hebrew Bible
- In  [[country/portugal/misc|Portugal]], there is an account of this method being practiced in 18th century.  Duke of Aveiro's palace in Lisbon was destroyed then salted promptly for his treason and conspiracy against the king himself Joseph I of Portugal.

It doesn't need to be solely used for malicious intents, one can use it for stopping the growth of wild plants and weeds. Or apply it between pavement tiles, bricks, where you don't want any weed or vegetation.

You just simply sprinkle it over the soil. 

It is quite difficult to clean the soil afterwards, so make sure apply it with caution or you may ruin the soil for good.
