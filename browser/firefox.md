Year is 2021 and firefox still can't live update for shit. I mean, have you ever head about applying updates on next restart ?? Do you really have to interrupt me and crash all my goddamn tabs while I'm busy. I don't give a damn that you'll restore my tabs back, i was busy smarty-pants. What if i had 20 tabs open in private window then ? Daft fox, pissing me off from time to time. Still, a decent browser. Always a go choice rather than a big corp b.s.
