### OS compatibility with kernel, hardware components etc.
- Can we just take out the system drive from computer A and plug it into computer B (doesn't have a system drive on it's own. Just assume doesn't have any drive). Would it work ? Would it boot into the OS
- Answer #1 (proven): 
- - For windows, this usually doesn't work unless the CPU on computer A is very similar or close relative of computer B's CPU. This is also due to the fact windows installs with specific to computer A's CPU, chipset, bios.
- Theory #2: 
- - For unix based system, i don't think it'll bother. Should work just fine. As long as you didn't mess with drivers or installed third party stuff, it's gotta work. 'Cause y'know, it's in the name. Plug and play.
