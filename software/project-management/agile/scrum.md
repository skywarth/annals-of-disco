# Scrum
Basically, next-big-thing that everyone wants to hope onto. Choosing the methodology according to the team and project is long gone.

## Agile doesn't mean scrum
It is a common misconception to think agile and scrum are the same. Well, no. Agile is a methodlogy group that consists scrum and many other methodologies. Scrum is the most famous one, hence it's like the cover-face of the agile. But it is certainly not.

Agile aims on release features regular basis. It is so waterfall to deploy the whole product in single action. 
- Focuses on ROI
- Req changes are often
- Allows discovering issues early on
- Periodic replanning


### Agile manifesto
- **Individuals and interactions**, over process and tools
- **Working software**, over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collab**, over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change**, over following a plan


## Foundation of Scrum

### Scrum Theory
- **Transparency**: Done means done, be honest
- **Inspection**: Check progress
- **Adaptation**: Change product based on inspection


### Scrum Skeleton
*minus the calcium*

- **Product Backlog**: Or just backlog. The list of things that needs to be done. Can grow over time, don't worry. I've never seen a project with clean backlog. It always contains tasks so old, the backlog is just like deep-freezer at that point. *I remember a tasks so deep in the backlog... It is said if you read the description to the mirror at 3AM, ghost developers of the forsaken past shall haunt you. Those poor men who attempted it...* 
- **Sprint backlog**: Just a bunch of tasks gathered from product backlog. Team members may take tasks from here.
- **Sprint**: Work plan for interval/period of X. Sprint period could be 1 week, 2 week, 30 days, 1.5 eons, 3 falls, 2 stories... JK, it's gotta be less than 30 days otherwise it's just stooped. Important thing here is that you have to deliver a deployment-ready product at the end of the sprint.
- **Daily sprint meeting**: just gather up with the team and check how's everyone doing. Review progress. See potential failures in advance.
