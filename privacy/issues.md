# Browser related privacy issues or cheeky techniques

### Favicon
Set cookies and unique identifiers by setting a series of favicon redirects etc. 0101000, you got it.

### FLoC by Google

Yet another illusion whereas it is claimed that this new way of tracking (rather than cookies) is more private. And of course its bs. Options shouldn't be old tracking (cookies) vs new tracking (FLoC). It should be tracking or no tracking. The way it is presented could be sensed as deceptive on it's own.

### Forced data extraction
*Sam, are we the baddies ?*
These tools are often used by authorities, but can also be used by general public.
- Grayshift
- Cellebrite
- UFED (Universal forensic extraction device)
- Exploits that use Zero-Day
They allow the user to forcefully extract certain data from the smart phone. Images, messages etc.
Can actually get the data in most cases. IPhone might do a better job at keeping the data encrypted and safe.
- If a device has gone under this process, it is eager that the device has a special data package planted inside. Which allows for geo tracking and more.
- In an emergency, you can maximize the security of your IPhone by pressing the side button 5 times.
- Know your rights, this is a personal device and you cannot be forced into unlocking it. *Uhhh, i think i forgot my pass. Sheeesh !*
- Never use biometric methods for they can kinda force this way to unlock the device.
- Shutdown the damn phone.

#### BFU (Before first unlock)
- As long as the device is not unlocked after cold boot, it is in the most secure state.

#### AFU (Before first unlock)
- Far more vulnerable compared to BFU
